My To-Do Planner
This is a simple and interactive To-Do Planner web application designed to help you organize your tasks. It allows you to add tasks with associated dates, and provides functionalities to manage (delete) them. The application is built using fundamental web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

‚ú® Features
Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks with a corresponding date.

Delete Tasks: Remove completed or unwanted tasks from your list.

Dynamic UI: Tasks are added and removed dynamically without page reloads.

Simple & Clean Design: Built with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a straightforward user experience.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML5: Provides the structure and content of the web page.

CSS3: Styles the application for a clean and user-friendly interface.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Powers the dynamic functionalities like adding and deleting tasks.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
You don't need any special server-side setup for this project. A modern web browser is sufficient.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/angras2881/todo-planner.git
cd todo-planner

(If you've been building this locally, just ensure you are in your project's root directory.)

No npm install needed for this specific project!
Since this project only uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without Node.js dependencies, you don't need to run npm install.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Application
You can open this application directly in your web browser.

Navigate to the project folder:
Open your file explorer/finder and go to the todo-planner directory.

Open index.html:
Double-click the index.html file. It will open in your default web browser.

Alternatively, you can use a simple local web server (like the http-server we discussed for Cypress) if you prefer:

Install http-server (if you haven't already):

npm install -g http-server

(The -g installs it globally, so you can run it from any directory.)

Start the server from your project directory:

http-server . -p 8080

Then, open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080.

üß™ Project Structure

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html                  # The main To-Do Planner web application
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                   # This file

(Note: This project is a standalone HTML/CSS/JS application. If you later integrate Cypress for testing, your project structure will expand to include Cypress-specific folders like cypress/e2e/, cypress/support/, cypress.config.js, package.json, and node_modules/.)
